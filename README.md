# Visao Viewer API
Open source repository for the [Visao](https://visao.ca/) Viewer API

## Documentation
Go to this [page](https://developers.visao.ca/docs/intro) to find the
Visao viewer API documentation.

## Contributing
_As of right now the API code as well as the documentation is not open source for
the simple reason that we like to keep our code into a monorepo._

**That said
we welcome any feedbacks, questions, bug reporting and feature requests you may provide.**

Simply go to the [issues page](https://github.com/Technologie-Visao/viewer-api/issues) and open
an issue assigning the proper tag to it.
